<h4>HTML5 CROSS PLATFORM GAME DEVELOPMENT<br/>USING PHASER 3</h4>
<p>Learn to build HTML5 games using Phaser 3 and other free software</p>
<p>Let me take you by hand from the basics of JavaScript programming and show you how to build complete cross platform HTML5 games using Phaser 3 framework and other free software.</p>
<p>Written by Emanuele Feronato</p>
<h4>A little preface</h4>
<p>I won't annoy you with boring introductions which everybody skips, I just want you to know why I am writing this book.</p>
<p>When I am about to start learning a new language or framework, and this happened a lot of times in more than 30 years â€“ and counting! - spent studying and working on programming languages, I always desperately look for a book able to guide me from the bare bones to the creation of an actual, complete project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most beginner guides just cover a brief overview, leaving it up to you to continue learning and experimenting, while advanced guides assume you already are an expert user.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do with this book is to take you by hand even if you are an absolute beginner and give you everything you need to build complete cross platform games from scratch.</p>
<p>For those of you having some acquired programming skills, I will guide you deep enough into the mechanics of game development.
I did my best for you to like this book and find it useful. And most of all I want to say thank you.
By buying this book you allowed me to concentrate on book and course development, which is something I really like.</p>
<p>Let's start.</p>
